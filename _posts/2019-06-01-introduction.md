This is part of WUS's efforts on applying AI in Urban Planning.

We are tracking AI progress by looking at performance improvements on benchmark datasets. They are organized by subtasks from main areas of ML, including <span style="color:#FFB300;font-weight:bold">COMPUTER_VISION</span>, <span style="color:#803E75;font-weight:bold">NATURAL_LANGUAGE_PROCESSING</span>, <span style="color:#A6BDD7;font-weight:bold">METHODOLOGY</span>, <span style="color:#C10020;font-weight:bold">MISCELLANEOUS</span>, <span style="color:#CEA262;font-weight:bold">SPEECH</span>, <span style="color:#817066;font-weight:bold">PLAYING_GAMES</span> and <span style="color:#007D34;font-weight:bold">GRAPHS</span>, each one elaborates corresponding datasets, also paper and code that acheved best preformance.

Some data are from [RedditSota](https://github.com/RedditSota/state-of-the-art-result-for-machine-learning-problems), [EFF AI metrics](https://github.com/AI-metrics/AI-metrics) and etc. This website would be updated weekly. Have fun.
