<p>This is part of WUSâ€™s efforts on applying AI in Urban Planning.</p>

<p>We are tracking AI progress by looking at performance improvements on benchmark datasets. They are organized by subtasks from main areas of ML, including <span style="color:#FFB300;font-weight:bold">COMPUTER_VISION</span>, <span style="color:#803E75;font-weight:bold">NATURAL_LANGUAGE_PROCESSING</span>, <span style="color:#A6BDD7;font-weight:bold">METHODOLOGY</span>, <span style="color:#C10020;font-weight:bold">MISCELLANEOUS</span>, <span style="color:#CEA262;font-weight:bold">SPEECH</span>, <span style="color:#817066;font-weight:bold">PLAYING_GAMES</span> and <span style="color:#007D34;font-weight:bold">GRAPHS</span>, each one elaborates corresponding datasets, also paper and code that acheved best preformance.</p>

<p>Some data are from <a href="https://github.com/RedditSota/state-of-the-art-result-for-machine-learning-problems">RedditSota</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AI-metrics/AI-metrics">EFF AI metrics</a> and etc. This website would be updated weekly. Have fun.</p>
